            <p>Hello! My name is Maria Simoes. I am a New Hampshirite of the Lakes Region and a lake girl at heart! Having grown up on the lake for so long, it was natural that my first job was as a camp counselor. During this time, I worked with children starting at the ages of 7 and up at the Arts & Crafts and Drama Programs, while also being a "camp mom" helping kids who were homesick. This developed into a fondness for working with kids and led into my ten years in the field of teaching.</p>

            <p>A graduate of UNH, I hold both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree in Teaching (MAT) in the field of Secondary English teaching. As a teacher, I hold two certifications in both Elementary Education (grades k-8) and English Teaching (grades 6-12). During my first nine years as a teacher I taught 7th Grade English/Language Arts and then decided to try something new in my final year by working as a 5th grade teacher.</p>

            <p>My fondness for knowledge and a desire to continue my personal learning has spurned me onto my next adventure in web development. After years of watching students achieve their own dreams, I am hoping to seek out new ones for myself that take me out of the classroom and into a field where I look forward to collaborating with a variety of new people and new ideas!</p>
